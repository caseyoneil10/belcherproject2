## Premise

 - **Problem:** Keeping track of my favorite movies or tv shows. Have you ever been asked whats your favorite movie and your brain goes blank? Or how about did you finish any shows recently you loved? With movie tracker its easy to reference any of the films or shows you add to your personal list!
 - **Purpose:** User can organize their favorite movies and shows and add data like a review, or update info about the film itself for easy reference in the future. They can also delete entries or create a new entry.
 - **Who:** Movie Lovers, who have a need to organize all of their favorite films for easy reference in the future.
## Technologies Used
 - Mongoosecd d
 - MongoDB
 - Node.js
 - JavaScript
 - Express.js
 - Bcrypt
 - CSS Frameworks (Skeleton & Normalize)
## Approach Taken
I started by building out the app with our 7 RESTful routes listed below.

This process came relatively quick with such a simple routes flow. In the future I want to establish a router flow earlier instead of going back and setting it up. Once CRUD was fully established I felt comfortable moving on to my stretch goals.

**Stretch Goals:**
1. Sort main page data objects alphabetically  
2.  Create a login/authentication flow
3.  Have data objects only linked to the user who is currently logged in.
4.  Utilize Partials
5.  Utilize a CSS Framework

I was able to achieve my stretch goals and implement them in the way I had imagined. I do think I could have "attacked" my work flow more efficiently in the future.

Especially in regards to styling with frameworks. I initially tried to use Bootstrap but I had not kept in mind the format that Boostrap likes things kept (lots of divs) and I ended up instead using Skeleton and Normalize and then my own CSS styling.

It took me a long time to figure out Authentication but it is an incredibly helpful functionality that I know feel much more comfortable with. It alone gave me the ability to link data objects to specific users and this alone has shown to be incredibly powerful!

## Future Goals

 - Add a Search Field to search the database and return objects with matches.
 - Have a function that sorts in various ways for the main index page instead of the hard coded sort that is currently enabled.
